# ME494-Data Driven Methods
 2024 Spring Independent Study on Data Driven Methods in Mechanical Engineering

## POD Analysis 
To practice POD analysis, we have taken a data set from  http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/data/collections/kk91fk98z. The data set that I chose for this assignment is low Reynolds number airfoil DNS with angle of attack of 25 degrees and pitching frequency of 0.05 degrees.
